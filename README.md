Problem Statement:

"Understanding Customer Behavior and Preferences in an E-commerce Platform"

Analyze a dataset containing customer transactional data from an e-commerce platform to uncover insights into customer behavior, preferences, and purchase patterns. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can guide marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and drive business growth.

Key Objectives:

Customer Segmentation: Identify distinct customer segments based on demographics (age, gender), purchase history ('Previous Purchases'), and preferences ('Category', 'Item Purchased') to better understand their behavior.

Purchase Patterns: Analyze 'Purchase Amount (USD)' across different categories ('Category'), seasons ('Season'), and other variables to identify popular products, seasonal trends, and areas for potential growth.

Customer Retention and Engagement: Investigate 'Subscription Status', 'Discount Applied', and 'Promo Code Used' to understand customer retention strategies, evaluate their effectiveness, and suggest improvements.

Preference Analysis: Explore 'Shipping Type', 'Payment Method', and their correlation with purchase behavior to optimize services and payment options for better customer experience.

Recommendation System: Develop a recommendation system based on past purchases ('Item Purchased') and customer preferences to offer personalized suggestions, enhancing user engagement and increasing sales.

Predictive Modeling: Build predictive models to forecast customer churn, predict purchase amounts, or anticipate trends in customer preferences using machine learning algorithms.

Time Series Analysis: Conduct time series analysis to identify temporal patterns in purchases, understand seasonal fluctuations, and optimize inventory management strategies.
